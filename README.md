# A sample of a roblet server module

If you want to develop a roblet server module from scratch - you may find the code in this repository useful.

It is a multi-module Maven project to ease building everything.
But still the idea is to have each of the modules to serve a separate purpose - not just as a some library:
* Roblet server module
* Interface library
* Command line utility
* Debian package
